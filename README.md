# Find-Me-Out-SOC
SOC 2023 project based on ML
As of Week 1 I have learned about the basics of python and machine learning.
Week 2- I have got a good exposure to the various python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn. Also got to learnhow to do the data cleaning before using it for training the model.
Week 3 was a little busy on my side so couldnt go through the material shared by mentor but i did make a beginner level machine learning model to enhance my knowledge.
